Implemented Q-learning and SARSA algorithms from scratch using OpenAI Gymâ€™s FrozenLake environment, managing custom Q-tables and designing epsilon-greedy exploration policies. Tuned hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factors, exploration decay) for optimal convergence and serialized models for reproducibility. Highlights deep understanding of reinforcement learning fundamentals, on-policy vs. off-policy learning, and dynamic programming concepts.
